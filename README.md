## Text Generation
LSTM Text Generation using Tensorflow
- In Tensorflow, LSTM is used to generate texts.
- Dataset file is `adele.txt`.
- In order to preprocess dataset and build train data, `Tokenizer`, which you can import `from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text` and which is used to convert text data to sequences, is utilized.
- Simple LSTM model is used to produce text. In addition, different LSTM approaches are illustrated in code.
- If you aim to produce more realistic text, you can enlarge your dataset so that quality of texts that you can generate can be improved.
